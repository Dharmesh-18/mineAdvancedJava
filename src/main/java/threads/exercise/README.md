## Lab:

You need to build a website status checker. The program takes a list of some popular websites and makes an HTTP GET request to each of the sites. If the site responds to HTTP traffic it will be considered as the `site is up` otherwise the `site is down`. You need to build the program using Java threads.

To start with you can take the below list of sites for this example and extend if you feel like.

- http://google.com
- http://facebook.com
- http://yahoo.com
- http://stackoverflow.com
- http://facebookblahblah.com
